# Flame-maker

Flame-maker is our first Java project, which creates Fractals with the [Fractal Flame Algorithm](http://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf).

A GUI made in [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html) is provided to edit the Transformations and modify the resulting Fractals.

## Try it
To try Flame-maker, compile the project with your favorite IDE, and execute the class `ch.epfl.flamemaker.gui.FlameMaker`
